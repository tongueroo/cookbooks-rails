Chef Recipes
===============

This is an example of a chef cookbooks project that can be used with the baker gem, https://github.com/tongueroo/baker.

This will install a simple rails stack: mysql, apache, passenger, and rails.

It is only a demo, I do not recommend using this to configure a real production server.

I've tested this with alestic's ubuntu 10.10 Mavervick AMIs.
